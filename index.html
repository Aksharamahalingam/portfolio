                            <p>Hi there! Here is a little bit about me.
                                At Barnard, I worked on intelligent systems and built a robot from scratch.
                                But I was equally curious about how people would understand and respond to what we were
                                building.</p>

                            <p>That curiosity led me to Harvard, where I traded the robotics lab for VR and AI in
                                education. I
                                became obsessed with what it takes for new technologies to move beyond a "cool demo" and
                                into
                                real practice.</p>

                            <p>Over time, I realized I did not just want to execute technical plans. I wanted to be
                                involved in
                                the decisions behind them: what to prioritize, what assumptions we were making, and how
                                those
                                decisions would play out once a system leaves the lab and meets the person using it.</p>

                            <p>Across robotics, VR, AI infrastructure, and academic planning systems, I have kept
                                returning to
                                the same goal: thinking through the decisions behind the build, not just the execution
                                of it.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Academic planning looks straightforward on paper, but in
                                practice it is shaped by prerequisite chains, policy exceptions, sequencing tradeoffs,
                                and limited course availability. Students often discover constraints too late.</p>
                            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Exploring a product direction that models degree requirements
                                as structured dependency logic rather than static checklists. The prototype represents
                                curriculum rules as a graph to surface potential blockers earlier.</p>

                            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Implemented SLAM and iterated on navigation logic with a
